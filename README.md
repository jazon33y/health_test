# health_test
R-shiny application, which uses confidence structure inference to determine the likelihood of being sick or well (red and blue, respectively) given a positive or negative test result.  Bounded confidence distributions are visualized as counts that reflect the uncertainty inhearant in the sensitivity, specificity and prevalence for which the test efficacy is based upon.  This transformation, from a statistical structure represented by bounded confidence distributions to counts, is called the Equivalent Binomial Count.

See below for a screenshot of what the app looks like.
